# Robust-SMILES-Generator-from-Chemical-Names
robust, automated generation of canonical SMILES from chemical names, even with inconsistent formatting, typos, and non-standard nomenclature. The workflow systematically cleans names, generates intelligent variants, and performs multi-tiered database lookups (PubChem REST, PubChemPy synonym, and OPSIN).
